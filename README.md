# DEPRECATED
A PATRICIA tree was implemented in [this other library of mine](https://github.com/gbrlsnchs/radix). Use that instead!

## Important
- Until version 1.0 is released, **anything** can change, including names of methods or even their existence.
- Until version [0.3.0], this package errouneously implemented a [radix tree], and not exactly a PATRICIA tree, 
which is a binary version of the radix tree. If you're looking for a radix tree implementation, try [this package] instead.

## About
This package is an implementation of a PATRICIA tree (or binary radix tree) in [Go] (or Golang).  

## Usage
Full documentation [here].  
[HEAD] holds the most recent features.
